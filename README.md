### Boycott GitHub

GitHub profits from mental and physical abuse of people in "detention" centres run by the US Government's ICE agency.

By continuting to use GitHub for your projects, you are also profiting from the torture of these people. If this is something you are not happy with, migrate your projects away from GitHub and place a similar message in your bio or personal repo like this encouraging others to do the same.
